        My Web Development module experience has been good, but I am still trying to learn 
        more about the coding and the different design implementations I could include onto this 
        and future sites. The online lectures have been very helpful and has helped with the assignment. 
        Also, Nile has helped me go back on some lectures I missed, and I have been able to go back to 
        it to get information on how to add different types of code onto my site. For the design of
        my site, I had a good idea on how I wanted my site to look such as the picture on my homepage 
        and the different colours I used on my site and the font. For the colours I wanted a light grey 
        and black and for the font I used Google Fonts. For debugging I used the html and CSS validation 
        sites to make sure my code was correct. However for my portfolio page i couldnt get the coloumns to work properly 
        which has resulted in the placeholder pictures to be large. Another problem ive had is that the hamburger icon would not display onto
        my page and when i tested the it using chrome developer tools it corrupted my page.
</p>
    <p>My ups of my module experience are that the code became more easier to understand I went through 
        the lectures and started to add code onto my site. Also, there are videos on YouTube which 
        helped me understand and show me different types of code. The downs have been that on some 
        sections on the assignment some of the code did not work so I had to investigate it to try 
        and fix the code. Sometimes the error was just that I missed a letter or that I had misspelt 
        a word which caused the code to not work. But overall, my experience of web development has 
        been positive, and I am interested in the future projects and understanding new code.

    <p>References, i have used some code for the navigation bar "I GOT THIS SOME OF THIS CODE FROM YOUTUBE VIDEO BY
        KEVIN POWELL OCTOBER 2016 "How to create an awesome navigation bar with HTML & CSS" this was so that my navigation bar was on 
    the left size and that it was spread put even and didnt interfere with my picture. My next reference is 
"I HAVE GOT SOME OF THIS CODE FROM YOUTUBE DARKCODE
Responsive Contact Us Form Using Only HTML & CSS 27TH JUNE 2018" is used this code to create the form, however i did the CSS code by myself.</p>
